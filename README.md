# Quality Control in Manufacturing Process

This project is about evaluating quality of production during manufacturing process. Quality control in manufacturing process with classification is a simple approach to detect a good or bad quality of a batch production with historical data from similar previous batch production. These archived information included input raw material, ratio of raw material in use, or material brand names in last production process. The information then will be used  as a training data set to establish a model classifier. For each algorithms or techniques used in creating a classifier, the prediction output may be different. Particularly, in this project, we applied 4 different algorithms for classification. From now, the model classifier will be used in order to predict the quality of current batch production and provide or make appropriate decision for next stage in production process.
